            <div class="text text-a">Types of Pollutants</div>
            <div class="text text-b" property="pollutants">Vehicle emissions contain various pollutants, including carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particulate matter (PM), and greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2). Each of these pollutants has its own detrimental effects on human health and the environment.</div>
