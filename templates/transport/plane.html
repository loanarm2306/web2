    <h1 property="title">Airplane Pollution</h1>
    <p property="description">Pollution is the introduction of substances or energy that alter the environment or the
        quality of life of living beings. It can take various forms, including air, water, soil, acoustic, light, and
        thermal pollution, among others.</p>

            <span property="name"> The Environmental Impact of Airplanes </span>>
            <p property="description">Airplanes, crucial for long-distance travel, contribute significantly to air
                pollution. Jet engines emit pollutants such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter,
                which degrade air quality and contribute to climate change.</p>
            <p property="description">Airports also generate pollution through ground transportation, aircraft servicing
                activities, and other operations. Noise pollution from aircraft can also have detrimental effects on
                local communities and wildlife.</p>
        <li>How do airports affect the environment?</li>
        <p property="description">Airport construction and expansion often lead to habitat destruction, noise pollution,
            and increased traffic congestion. Runway construction and expansion may require land clearance, leading to
            habitat loss and fragmentation.</p>
        <p property="description">Airport operations also consume significant amounts of energy and water, contributing
            to resource depletion and greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
